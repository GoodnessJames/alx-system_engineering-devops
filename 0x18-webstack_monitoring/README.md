# 0x18. Webstack Monitoring
This project entailed the establishment of a Datadog account for the purpose of
monitoring server traffic across three ALX servers.
The primary objective was to leverage Datadog's monitoring and analytics capabilities
to gain comprehensive insights into the performance, health, and activities of these
servers. By configuring the Datadog account, specific metrics and parameters relevant
to server traffic were monitored in real-time, allowing for proactive identification
of potential issues, optimization of resource utilization, and overall enhancement of
server management. The utilization of Datadog in this context aimed to ensure the
reliability, security, and efficient operation of the ALX servers through continuous
monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
