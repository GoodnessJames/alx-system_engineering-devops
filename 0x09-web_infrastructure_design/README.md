# Web Infrastructure Design
For a whole week, I embarked on a fascinating project exploring web design. Think of it like going on
an exciting adventuire! First, I read a lot to learn about the best ways to create web systems.

Then, I used paper as my giant canvas to draw diagrams. It was like my personal magic board where I could
sketch out ideas. At first, I started with a basic plan called LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl).
But I didn't stop there!

I kept learning and drawing, and my project turned into a super-duper web system. It could do lots of things,
and it was super safe and carefully monitored.

I didn't want to keep all the fun to myself, so I wrote down everything and put it in files. Each file has a link
to a picture of the diagrams I drew on paper. Think of it like a storybook with pictures, but it's all about making web systems!

So, my project was an awesome journey, and now I have all these files to show everyone how I did it. It was a blast!
