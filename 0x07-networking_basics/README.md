# Networking basics #0
This project was the first in a series of two projects introducing networking concepts.
During this project, I addressed several quiz-like questions and authored a couple of
Bash scripts as I delved into topics such as the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, as well as
TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

## Description of Project Task Files

* **0. OSI model**
  * [0-OSI_model](./0-OSI_model): Text file answering the following questions:
  * What is the OSI model?
  * How is the OSI model organized?

* **1. Types of network**
  * [1-types_of_network](./1-types_of_network): Text file answering the following questions:
  * What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
  * What type of network could connect an office in one building to another
  office in a building a few streets away?
  * What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

* **2. MAC and IP address**
  * [2-MAC_and_IP_address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address): Text file answering the following questions:
  * What is a MAC address?
  * What is an IP address?

* **3. UDP and TCP**
  * [3-UDP_and_TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP): Text file answering the following questions
  (boxes refer to an image provided by ALX SE School):
  * Which statement is correct for the TCP box?
  * Which statement is correct for the UDP box?
  * Which statement is correct for the TCP worker?

* **4. TCP and UDP ports**
  * [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): Bash script that displays listening ports.
  * Only shows listening sockets.
  * Displays the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

* **5. Is the host on the network**
  * [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network): Bash script that
  pings an IP address received as an argument 5 times.
  * Usage: `5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}`.
